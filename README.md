Project Description
RetroFuture Rumours 
is a quirky web-based newsletter generator that “travels through time” to report
bizarre, completely made-up historical events for any year the user enters. The site transforms a
boring year input into an absurdly creative newsletter that no historian asked for, but everyone
secretly needs.

The Problem
People are tired of boring history lessons that only focus on real facts. Nobody ever talks about
the Great Broccoli Uprising of 3504 or the Sky Disco of 1892. Without these important (fake)
records, future generations may never laugh at the absurdity of alternative history.

The Solution
Our web app accepts any year from the user, spins the clock wildly, and spits out a breaking-
news-style newsletter with surreal, AI-generated historic events. Using a randomised template
system, no two visits are ever quite the same — finally filling the world’s desperate need for fake
historical journalism.

Technical Details Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
 Languages Used:
o HTML5 (Structure of pages)
o CSS3 (Styling and layout)
o Python (Logic engine for randomised fake history)
 Frameworks:
o Flask (Backend server, routing, and integration between HTML and Python logic)
o Jinja2 (Templating to inject generated stories into HTML dynamically)
